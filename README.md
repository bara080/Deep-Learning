# Deep-Learning
# Binary Pattern Autoencoder

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple autoencoder using PyTorch to learn and reconstruct binary patterns. The autoencoder is trained on a dataset of 8-dimensional binary vectors.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 8-dimensional binary vectors, representing all possible binary patterns of length 8 with a single `1` in different positions.

## Files
- `main.py`: The main Python script that defines, trains, and evaluates the autoencoder model.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the necessary libraries to run the project.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib

# Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binary-pattern-autoencoder.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd binary-pattern-autoencoder

Run the main script

python decoder.py

This will train the autoencoder on the binary patterns and display the training loss curve and a comparison of the original and reconstructed binary patterns.

Results

The training loss curve is displayed to show the progress of the model training.
The original binary patterns and their reconstructed versions are displayed for comparison.
